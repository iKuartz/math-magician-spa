# Math Magicians

> A single page app created with react to operate as a calculator and display some quotes from philosophers and mathematicians.

[Screenshot of the UI](./src/imgs/screenshot.png)

"Math Magicians" is a single page app that displays a calculator allows you to make basic operations. Now the functionalities and the main logic of the app are ready. You can use the calculator by clicking its buttons. The code was completely refactored to work with React functions instead of classes.

### First requirements:


    Set up the environment and tools needed to develop a React application. In the following projects, I will develop the actual application.

    The easiest way to create a React application is using Create React App (CRA) and following the instructions in this [guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app).
    The application should run in the browser without errors.


### Second requirements:

    Delete all the boilerplate from CRA (text, images, styles).
    Create a directory called components.
    Inside components, create a new Calculator.js file.
    In Calculator.js, create a React component that matches this design:

Calculator

    Don't add any extra design.
    Develop just the UI of the calculator; the math logic to make it work will be added in the next project.
    Use class based components.
    Once the Calculator is ready, import it and use it in your main component (App.js).
    Test it in the browser; it should render without problems.

### Third requirements:


    Copy the files calculate.js and operate.js into a logic/ directory in your project.
    Analyze the files calculate.js and operate.js, be sure you understand what they do.
    Import the files in your Calculator component.
    Implement the event handlers you need to use the math logic from calculate.js and operate.js in your React component.
    Practice what you have learned until now: use state and props, pass props to child components, use lifecycle methods, lift state up.
    Test your app in the browser. It should be able to perform math operations.

### Fourth requirements:


    Refactor the Calculator component (components/Calculator.js) from a class based component to a functional component with hooks.
    After the refactor is done, test the app in the browser. It should keep the same functionality.

> To setup the project on your machine:

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and setup the linters

## Prerequisites
